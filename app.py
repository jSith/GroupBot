I have quite a few online pdf books that are being used at unl in many classes. PM me with the title of the book or the ISBN and I will most likely be able to get it for you for a cheap price. Most likely 20 to 30 dollars which is a great deal when most places online would still charge over a 100 dollars for a single textbook in an online format. If you would like to know whether I have your book just PM me on messenger and Iâ€™ll see what I can do for you.",

Burning kettle corn is a fun part of many people's college experience, but you should be careful. \n If you want advice on how to responsibly burn your kettle corn, feel free to PM me. I don't personally burn kettle corn anymore, but I think that, whoever you are, you may benefit from some advice on burning kettle corn. \n PS The burnt kettle corn is weed",
        'rickandmorty': "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase 'Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,' which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \n And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid"
