textbook,Hi friends! I know that textbooks can be expensive and this place is a great way to have that cost reduced. I have quite a few online pdf books that are being used at unl in many classes. PM me with the title of the book or the ISBN and I will most likely be able to get it for you for a cheap price. Most likely 20 to 30 dollars which is a great deal when most places online would still charge over a 100 dollars for a single textbook in an online format. If you would like to know whether I have your book just PM me on messenger and I?ll see what I can do for you.

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call sentient life. You're fucking harvested, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in 700 different ways, and that's just with my omnitool. Not only am I extensively trained in biotic combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the N7 marines and the Specters and I will use them to their full extent to wipe you off the face of the citadel, you little space cow.

kettlecorn,"Hey not to judge people that want to burn kettle corn at 1:15AM on a Sunday, but you should know that your vents are connected to certain wings of Kauffman and most of us can smell your burnt kettle corn. \n If you are going to burn kettle corn in your room (and I am not against you doing so) you should open a window so no one smells your burnt kettle corn. \n I know that the smell of burnt kettle corn is unpleasant to some people, and I imagine Toby would be upset if the smell of burnt kettle corn somehow made it to his room. \n Raikes students have gotten punished for burning kettle corn in the past. Burning kettle corn is a fun part of many people's college experience, but you should be careful. \n If you want advice on how to responsibly burn your kettle corn, feel free to PM me. I don't personally burn kettle corn anymore, but I think that, whoever you are, you may benefit from some advice on burning kettle corn. \n PS The burnt kettle corn is weed"
rickandmorty,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase 'Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,' which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \n And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid"
smarthumblehungry,"There will be times in life where people will doubt you, hate on you, and break you down. They don't believe in you and want to see you fail. These people will do everything in their power to watch you crash, burn, and fail. \n But in the true creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators nothing or no-one can stop the will to succeed, the perseverance to inspire, or the drive for greatness. Obstacles are meant to be overcome, conquered, defeated. The hate of the individuals who don't want to see you succeed will never overcome the fire in your soul that makes you wake up every day to prove the world wrong and silent the disbelievers. \n I didn't join the Jefferey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Business to be told I could't sell vouchers for Kona Ice outside Selleck, I joined to defy the odds of the ones who told me it couldn't be done and shut me down. \n To the kids out there with a dream, don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. Don't let anyone stop you from achieving the ambitions beyond your wildest dreams. Don't let anyone tell you different; just tell them what can be done. \n I will sell those Kona Ice tickets and I will prove it can be done because I'm smart, humble, and hungry. \n - Tim Roty 2018"

htmlparse,"You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The <center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the n?erves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror.

tragedy,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. \n It?s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It?s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life? \n He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful? the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. \n Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

raikesandmorty,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to get into the Raikes School of Computer Science and Management. The application prompts are extremely vague, and without a solid grasp of innovation processes, most of the applications won't even reach Anna Pressler's hands. There's also Steve's capitalist outlook, which is deftly woven into his lectures - his humble, hungry, smart philosophy draws heavily from Ideal Team Player, for instance. The students understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these teachings, to realize that they're not just educational- they say something deep about LIFE. \n As a consequence people who dislike the Raikes School truly ARE idiots- of course, they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the simplicity in Steve's existential catchphrase \""At Stanford\"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Alice's extensive development I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Steve Cooper's genius unfolds itself on the whiteboard. What fools... how I pity them. And yes, by the way, I DO have a Raikes School tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

doorstop,"Crosspost from KRA, but not everyone checks there, so I thought I'd post this here as well. \n Hey guys, so a lot of you have probably heard about the decision at KRA last night to ban doorstops, in addition to magneting your door. While I am personally against this decision, I wanted to at least put in a few words in defense of the decision. \n According to the 2018-2019 Kauffman housing contracts, on page 14, there is a clause which states: \n 'Any activity deemed by Housing staff to be a threat to the health and safety of residents is strictly prohibited. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: throwing anything out of a window, physical assault, or threat of physical altercation.' \n Based on this umbrella clause, if Christian deemed that having doorstops was a threat to our safety, then by our contract, he has a right to ban doorstops unilaterally. \n Be that as it may, if you're upset about this, like many are, I'd highly encourage you to come to the KRA meeting 2 Mondays from now (September 10th) at 9:30 to voice your opinion respectfully and courteously. If we act like whiny and entitled kids, then we'll be treated like whiny and entitled kids. If we come to the meeting and act like we just are lazy and that's why we want doorstops, then there's really not a good argument, but if we bring up the fact that doorstops build community, and encourage spontaneous interactions with our peers, then we have a pretty damn good argument on our side. \n In short, even though Christian might not change his mind about this, we still have a venue to make our voices heard in a reasonable and calm way. I'm going to be there next week, and if you feel strongly about that aspect of our community, you should be too."
